    <h1>SDL Saver</h1>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.modeemi.fi/%7Eflux/software/">Other stuff</a> I've written.</p>

    <p>SDL Saver is a patch for xscreensaver to provide a hack which
    permits you to run mostly any SDL program as your screen saver. In
    addition to providing the support for running SDL programs, you
    may use any software that allows its X11 window id to be
    defined. With SDL the mechanism used is the SDL_WINDOWID
    environment variable.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <a href="http://www.modeemi.fi/%7Eflux/software/sdlsaver/xscreensaver-4.24-sdlsaver-ver2.patch">SDL Saver ver 2: patch against xscreensaver 4.24</a>

    <h2>Installing to a Debian/Ubuntu system</h2>

    <p>Here's how to install the patch to a Debian/Ubuntu system.</p>
<pre>wget http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~flux/xscreensaver-4.24-sdlsaver-ver1.patch
apt-get source xscreensaver
sudo apt-get build-dep xscreensaver
cd xscreensaver-4.24
patch -p1 ../xscreen*.patch
./configure
make
sudo install hacks/sdlsaver /usr/lib/xscreensaver/sdlsaver 
sudo install -m 644 hacks/config/sdlsaver.xml /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/
echo 'xscreensaver*programs: sdlsaver' | xrdb -merge
xscreensaver &amp;
</pre>
    
    <p>Not click settings open, or if you miss the opening dialog, run
    xscreensaver-demo. Configure the saver with the appropriate
    binary/shell script.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, you could just build the binary sdlsaver and copy it
    with the configuration file sdlsaver.xml to the appropriate
    directory.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2> 

    <p>Use xscreesaver-demo to switch to SDL Saver. Configure the
    program parameter. If you need to pass custom parameters to it
    (the parameter entered is the binary name, nothing else), use a
    shell script. Sorry, this is a crude one-evening hack.</p>

    <p>You may use any program that can be fed the X11 window id as a
    parameter. Simply write a shell script that takes the environment
    variable SDL_WINDOWID and passes it down to the actual
    program. See below for an example.</p>

    <p><em>Note: in the script, it is important to handle SIGTERM
    properly. Most often this is easily done by execing the final
    program to run!</em></p>

    <h2>Playing videos</h2>

    <p>I personally run a shell script doing the following shell
    script as my screensaver:</p>

    <pre>#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/mplayer -loop 0 -fs -vo sdl ~/X/ombpes.mov &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null
    </pre>

    <p>At this point someone might notice "Hey, why did you make this
    SDL-specific at all, why not just provide the display as an
    argument to the shell script you're bound to write anyway" (or use
    a format-string kind of approach), and rightly so. Reason: I
    first hacked it to work with SDL and didn't want to redo it,
    managing patches is a bother. It's a screensaver!</p>

    <h2>Running any piece of software</h2>

    <p>Here is a shell script I used to run custom programs as the
    screen saver binary:</p>

    <pre>#!/bin/sh
trap 'kill $xpid' TERM
Xephyr -noreset -once -ac -parent $SDL_WINDOWID :1 &amp;
xpid=$!
sleep 1
export DISPLAY=:1
xlock -geometry 512x384+0+0 -nolock -inwindow -mode ifs &amp;
xlock -geometry 512x384+512+0 -nolock -inwindow -mode ifs &amp;
xlock -geometry 512x384+0+384 -nolock -inwindow -mode ifs &amp;
xlock -geometry 512x384+512+384 -nolock -inwindow -mode ifs &amp;
wait
    </pre>
