<h1>Hacking GLUT to Eliminate the glutMainLoop() Problem.</h1>
Mark Kilgard's GLUT library is one of the most truly useful aids to portable
programming. It carefully hides all the ugly issues of window manipulation,
producing simple menu's, keboard, mouse and joystick I/O. If your application
can tolerate the restrictions of GLUT, it's a breeze to write code that
will port across dozens of dissimilar platforms.
<h2>There has to be a 'BUT'...</h2>
Yep - there certainly is. GLUT is a strictly event driven library.
Essentially, all GLUT applications must set up callbacks for all
the events they are interested in (Keystrokes, redisplay, resize,
mouse clicks, etc) - and then hand over control to a GLUT function
called 'glutMainLoop()' - which never returns. That's fine for simple
programs that don't use certain other libraries - but now and again,
you'll want to link a GLUT program to another library that ALSO assumes
control of the main loop. Another time this can be a pain is if you
want to retro-fit a simple user interface into an existing, complex
application which might not be able to use the glutIdleFunc callback.
<p>
This turns off a lot of users and IMHO is an unnecessary restriction.
</p><h2>So What Can I do About It?</h2>
There are several ways to get around the problem of needing another
library that also wants to 'own' the main loop.
<ul>
<li> You could attack the OTHER library and try to remove its
     main-loop restriction. That isn't always possible - and
     if you don't have the sources to the other library then
     you've had it.
</li><li> You could try to create multiple execution threads - one
     for GLUT's main loop, another for the other library. That
     won't work in all operating systems - and some libraries
     are not at all thread-safe. This sometimes works well
     though.
</li><li> You can hack GLUT.
</li></ul>
The last option is really the reason for this Web page. I
have found that a dozen lines of code is all that's required
and the resulting hacked GLUT remains 100% compatible with
the original library.
<h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
Locate the GLUT source code. In every release I have examined,
there will be a file named <code>lib/glut/glut_event.c</code>
<p>
Inside that file you'll find the source for glutMainLoop().
In outline it looks like this:
</p><pre>
/* CENTRY */
void APIENTRY
glutMainLoop(void)
{
  &lt;some_error_checking&gt;

  for (;;) {
    &lt;some_other_code&gt;
  }
}
/* ENDCENTRY */

</pre>
This may be changed to look like this:
<pre>
  /* CENTRY */
  void APIENTRY
  glutMainLoop(void)
  {
    for(;;)
      glutMainLoopUpdate () ;
  }
  /* ENDCENTRY */

  /* CENTRY */
  void APIENTRY
  glutMainLoopUpdate(void)
  {
    &lt;some_error_checking&gt;
    &lt;some_other_code&gt;
  }
  /* ENDCENTRY */

</pre>
You'll have to add a declaration for glutMainLoopUpdate() into
glut.h:
<pre>
  extern void APIENTRY glutMainLoop(void);
  extern void APIENTRY glutMainLoopUpdate(void);

</pre>
Recompile...and that's it.
<h2>How Do I Use It?</h2>
Now, your code can change from:
<pre>
  glutMainLoop () ;

</pre>
...to...
<pre>
  while ( 1 )
    glutMainLoopUpdate () ;

</pre>
But more usefully, you can now use one of the callbacks of some
other library to call the new glutMainLoopUpdate() function:
<pre>
  some_other_library_IdleFunc ( glutMainLoopUpdate ) ;
  some_other_library_MainLoop () ;

</pre>
<h2>Is this Reliable?</h2>
It certainly seems to be - I know of dozens of people who have
used this hack (or something very close to it) without any
problems. All current GLUT implementations can be fixed in
the exact same way.
<p>
It does have a microscopic effect on performance because the
error checking that glutMainLoop() used to do only once is
now done in every iteration of glutMainLoopUpdate(). However,
in all current GLUT releases, the amount of checking is truly
negligable - so this should not be a concern. If it worries you
then dump the error checking code - it's not checking for anything
too subtle - just making sure you called glutInit and opened a
window.
</p><h2>Will This Become a Part of the Normal GLUT Release?</h2>
Well, I begin to doubt it. It seems a simple enough change - and
there is no doubt that people find it useful. However, I have
now asked Mark Kilgard to include it in the release on several
occasions.  He refuses on grounds of unnecessary complexity - I don't
understand that view - but GLUT is his baby and he has the right
to release whatever he wants.
