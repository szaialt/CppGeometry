	* glew.i (Repository): removed include of GL.h.  No need for it
	and it can confuse some compiliers due to symbol redefinition.

	* glew.i (Repository): added ability to disable loading of
	shared library via -Dsdljava.bootclasspath value  or
	-Dgljava.bootclasspath (any value prevents loading of shared libs)
